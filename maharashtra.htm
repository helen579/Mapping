<p style="font-size:20px;">Maharashtra is a state in the western and central peninsular region of India occupying a substantial portion of the Deccan Plateau. The centre of India is in this state. Maharashtra is the second-most populous state in India as well as the third-most populous country subdivision in the world. It was formed on 1 May 1960 by splitting the bilingual Bombay State, which had existed since 1956, into majority Marathi-speaking Maharashtra and Gujarati-speaking Gujarat. Thus Maharashtra is a Marathi linguistic state. The state is divided into 6 divisions and 36 districts, with the state capital being Mumbai, also the most populous urban area in India and Nagpur serving as the winter capital. The Godavari and the Krishna are the two major rivers in the state.</p>
